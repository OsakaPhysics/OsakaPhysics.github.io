### **S-O6 (Silly Overseer Council) Memo**  

**From:** S-01 ("John")  
**To:** All Site-E Personnel  

"Hey, uh, so about SCP-E-501, the universe-destroying popcorn kernel? Yeah, we need to keep that thing *chill*. Like, literally. I don’t care if you’re craving a snack or trying to pull a prank—this is not the kernel you want to mess with.  

We already lost Site-E-23 because someone thought it was 'just one little kernel.' SPOILER ALERT: IT’S NOT.  

So here’s the deal:  
1. No microwaves near SCP-E-501.  
2. No campfires.  
3. NO 'let’s see what happens' experiments.  
4. And for the love of everything silly, S-04, stop calling it the 'Cosmic Popcorn Challenge.' It’s not funny anymore.  

P.S. S-06 has requested that we add a sticker to the containment chamber that says, 'Do Not Pop.' It better be holographic and fun. Otherwise, what's the point? Oh right.. Professionality.. HELL NAW!"
